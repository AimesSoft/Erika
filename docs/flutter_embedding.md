# Flutter Embedding

[中文](flutter_embedding.zh.md) | [English](flutter_embedding.md) | [日本語](flutter_embedding.ja.md)

Erika is not a Flutter video renderer. Flutter is an optional host UI.
The player owns decode, timing, native rendering, subtitles, danmaku, audio, and
HDR presentation.

## API Families

There are two C ABI entrypoint families:

- `ErikaHandle`: control and event API. Use this when the host owns its own
  presenter loop or only wants to probe/control playback.
- `ErikaPresenterHandle`: presenter-owned API. Use this when Erika should
  own `Player + renderer + audio output` and the host only supplies a
  native surface plus a display-tick callback.

Both families are declared in `crates/erika_capi/include/erika.h`.

## Apple Surface Strategies

The Apple HDR path uses a native Metal-backed surface, not Flutter Texture.
The Flutter plugin intentionally exposes two native surface strategies on
macOS, iOS, and tvOS so hosts can pick the composition model that matches their
UI.

### ErikaVideoView (Platform View)

Standard Flutter platform view backed by `NSView`/`CAMetalLayer` on macOS and
`UIView`/`CAMetalLayer` on iOS/tvOS. The plugin creates a native video view
registered as `erika_flutter/video_view`, attaches it to the presenter, and
drives rendering from a display link.

This path is useful for simple embedders and diagnostics. On macOS it is not the
recommended production path because AppKit/Flutter platform view composition can
show black flicker or other compositor artifacts.

### ErikaWindowOverlayVideoView (Window Overlay)

For the preferred HDR/EDR path, the plugin creates a window-hosted native
overlay that sits outside Flutter's platform-view compositor:

1. Dart `ErikaWindowOverlayVideoView` reserves a rectangle in the widget tree.
2. The platform plugin creates a window-level native view with a `CAMetalLayer`
   as a sibling/underlay of the Flutter host view.
3. Flutter paints the widget region transparent, leaving a hole for native video.
4. The widget tracks its position and sends geometry updates with a surface
   generation number, so stale hide calls from disposed widgets cannot affect
   newly attached surfaces.
5. Attach retry with exponential backoff handles window readiness timing.

The overlay path is the recommended path for NipaPlay and other full-player
UIs. It keeps video presentation owned by Erika/Metal while Flutter remains a
control and layout layer. On iOS/tvOS the native side uses a window plus a
sibling `UIView`/`CAMetalLayer`; on macOS it uses the host `NSWindow` plus a
sibling `NSView`/`CAMetalLayer`.

Touch events pass through both native video strategies, so Flutter controls can
remain above or around the video surface.

### ErikaTextureVideoView (Flutter Texture)

`ErikaTextureVideoView` renders through Flutter's texture registrar instead of a
platform view. On macOS the plugin allocates an IOSurface-backed
`CVPixelBuffer` pool, renders into its Metal texture directly (no per-frame CPU
readback), and publishes frames to Flutter, so regular Flutter effects —
`Opacity`, clipping, transforms, and color filters — apply to the video. On
OpenHarmony it reuses the registered external texture. On other platforms it
falls back to `ErikaVideoView`.

When `blendMode` is not `srcOver` on macOS, the widget routes back to the native
platform view so Core Animation can blend the video against the real backdrop
(see Transparent Video and Blend Modes below).

## Android Surface Strategies

On Android, both video widgets use the same native-view selector. SDR uses a
real `TextureView` and has been verified. wgpu selects Vulkan with a bounded
GLES fallback. Requesting `ErikaOutputMode.extendedLinear` instead creates a
`SurfaceView` through `PlatformViewLink` and Hybrid Composition so FP16 scRGB
does not pass through Flutter's texture-layer compositor. `Choreographer`
drives the surface, while lifecycle, resize, audio focus, and output fallback
remain owned by the plugin.

The FP16 extended-linear scRGB implementation is complete, including
`Rgba16Float` negotiation and `ADATASPACE_SCRGB_LINEAR` verification. Its active
path is not yet claimed as device-validated: final acceptance still requires an
API 35 HDR device. Unsupported displays, GLES, `TextureView`, missing FP16, or
dataspace verification failures continue in SDR with a queryable fallback
reason and explicit logs.

## HarmonyOS Surface Strategies

On HarmonyOS, use `ErikaVideoView`. The ArkTS plugin registers a Flutter
external texture, takes that texture's surface as an `OHNativeWindow`, and
attaches it to the presenter; wgpu then renders through Vulkan, using
`VK_OHOS_surface` for window-system integration.

Video decoding defaults to HarmonyOS AVCodec (H.264 and HEVC). AVCodec decodes
straight into a Surface, whose `OHNativeBuffer` is imported as a Vulkan
external image and resolved by a Vulkan YCbCr sampler, so decoded frames reach
the compositor with no CPU copy. Subtitles, danmaku, and overlays composite in
the same wgpu pass as every other platform.

Devices missing the required Vulkan extensions fall back to FFmpeg software
decode with CPU upload. The fallback is reported through `VideoDecoderChanged`
events and presenter diagnostics instead of failing playback. The HarmonyOS
path is validated on device; CI builds the OpenHarmony C ABI but has no
device-side run verification.

## Transparent Video and Blend Modes

Erika can present alpha-bearing video assets while keeping Flutter layout and
composition. Transparency is requested per player:

```dart
final player = ErikaPlayer(
  videoAlphaMode: ErikaVideoAlphaMode.packedAlphaRight,
);
```

`ErikaVideoAlphaMode.packedAlphaRight` expects a side-by-side encoded frame:
the left half is colour and the right half is a grayscale alpha mask. The GPU
presentation shaders (Metal, wgpu, D3D11) reconstruct a premultiplied-alpha
frame, and the video is presented at half the encoded width. Players that do
not request the mode interpret the frame as fully opaque, so existing content
is unaffected.

Blending and opacity are requested on the video widgets:

```dart
ErikaTextureVideoView(
  player: player,
  blendMode: BlendMode.overlay,
  opacity: 0.8,
)
```

Platform support differs:

| Platform and path | `blendMode` | `opacity` |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| macOS, `ErikaTextureVideoView` (Flutter texture) | `srcOver` only; other modes route to the native layer | Flutter `Opacity` |
| macOS, native layer (`blendMode != srcOver`) | `overlay` supported; other values ignored | Native `CALayer` opacity |
| Windows window overlay (DirectComposition) | `srcOver`, `overlay`; other values raise a plugin error | `IDCompositionEffectGroup` opacity |
| Android / iOS / OpenHarmony | Accepted in creation parameters; not consumed | Flutter-side on texture paths |

Overlay blending is backdrop-aware: the macOS native layer composites against
the content behind the video inside the window, and the Windows blend effect
samples the same HWND, so the underlying Flutter or game content stays visible.
Transparent Windows overlay video uses an SDR BGRA8 premultiplied composition
swap chain bound to the Flutter HWND; HDR sources are tone-mapped into that
composition space inside Erika. Opaque Windows overlay video keeps the
dedicated child-HWND path used previously, and the composition content is
rebound automatically if the decoder or output device rebuilds the swap chain.

## iOS Build Path

The iOS plugin links the Erika C ABI static library into the app through a
CocoaPod script phase. By default it downloads the matching prebuilt archive;
set `ERIKA_FORCE_SOURCE_BUILD=1` (with `ERIKA_REPO_ROOT`) to build the Rust
`erika_capi` crate for the target iOS architecture instead.

## tvOS Build Path

The tvOS plugin links the Erika C ABI static library through its CocoaPod script
phase. Like iOS it downloads the prebuilt archive by default, with
`ERIKA_FORCE_SOURCE_BUILD=1` falling back to building from source. It supports
tvOS 13+, arm64 devices, and arm64/x86_64 simulators. See
[`packages/erika_flutter/README.md`](../packages/erika_flutter/README.md) for
nightly, prebuilt-bundle, and source-build options.

## macOS Build Path

The macOS pod uses the same script-phase build. Inside an Erika checkout (when
`crates/erika_capi/Cargo.toml` exists above the package, or `ERIKA_REPO_ROOT`
points at one) it builds the Rust `erika_capi` from source by default, so local
renderer changes are picked up without a new prebuilt release. Published
packages and isolated consumers — including git dependencies resolved into the
pub cache, which keep the whole repository and therefore also build from
source — need a Rust toolchain for that path; set `ERIKA_FORCE_PREBUILT=1` to
always download the checksummed prebuilt archive instead.

## Minimal Presenter Flow

```c
ErikaPresenterHandle *presenter = erika_presenter_create();
erika_presenter_attach_metal_layer(
    presenter,
    (uint64_t)cametal_layer,
    width,
    height,
    backing_scale);
erika_presenter_open(presenter, "/path/to/media.mp4");
erika_presenter_play(presenter);

// On every display tick:
ErikaPresenterStats stats;
erika_presenter_render_tick(presenter, host_time_seconds, &stats);

// On resize:
erika_presenter_resize_surface(presenter, width, height, backing_scale);

// On dispose:
erika_presenter_detach_surface(presenter);
erika_presenter_destroy(presenter);
```

## Flutter Texture Path

Flutter Texture is a lower-capability compatibility path.

Useful for:
- SDR fallback.
- Platforms where native view composition is not ready.
- Transparent video that should participate in Flutter's compositor
  (`ErikaTextureVideoView` on macOS and OpenHarmony).
- Test surfaces or constrained embedding environments.

It is not the preferred HDR/EDR route because video enters Flutter's
compositor. On Apple the surface is an IOSurface-backed `CVPixelBuffer`: the
host registers a Flutter texture, selects the frame's Metal texture with
`erika_presenter_attach_flutter_texture` and
`erika_presenter_set_flutter_texture_buffer` before every render tick, and
Flutter composites the same buffer without a CPU readback. The host keeps
ownership of the pixel buffers.

## wgpu and Android

The Apple HDR path remains native Metal, and Windows uses a native Direct3D 11
renderer (D3D11VA zero-copy decode, HDR10 output). On Android, wgpu is the active
renderer: Vulkan imports MediaCodec Surface frames through AHardwareBuffer, and
software frames have an explicit CPU-upload fallback. Video, subtitles,
danmaku, capture, and ArtCNN compute share this path. Vulkan can negotiate FP16
extended-linear scRGB; GLES and failed capability negotiation explicitly fall
back to SDR. Android SDR is verified, while the API 35 HDR-device active-path
acceptance remains pending. Linux support remains planned.

## Dart API

```dart
final player = ErikaPlayer(
  outputMode: ErikaOutputMode.appleEdr,  // optional: force EDR
  edrHeadroom: 4.0,                      // optional: EDR headroom
  // optional: side-by-side colour/alpha assets presented with transparency
  videoAlphaMode: ErikaVideoAlphaMode.packedAlphaRight,
);

await player.open(
  'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  httpHeaders: <String, String>{
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token',
    'Referer': 'https://example.com/',
  },
  httpReadAheadBytes: 16 * 1024 * 1024,
);
await player.play();

// Preferred for full-player UIs on macOS/iOS/tvOS:
ErikaWindowOverlayVideoView(player: player)

// Flutter-composited video with opacity/clipping/filters (macOS/OpenHarmony):
ErikaTextureVideoView(player: player, opacity: 0.8)

// Compatibility/diagnostic platform-view path:
ErikaVideoView(player: player)

// Playback control
await player.pause();
await player.seek(Duration(seconds: 30));
await player.setVolume(0.8);
await player.setPlaybackRate(1.5);

// Neural upscaler (anime luma 2x; Apple Metal / Android Vulkan)
await player.setUpscaler(ErikaUpscalerMode.artCnnC4F16Ds); // recommended for visibly degraded sources
final status = await player.getUpscalerStatus();
// status.requestedMode  -- what was requested
// status.activeBackend  -- off / inactive / building / scalar / simdgroupMatrix
// status.upscaledFrames -- frames produced by the network so far

// Track management
final tracks = await player.tracks();
for (final track in tracks) {
  if (track.kind == ErikaTrackKind.video && track.selected) {
    print('${track.codec} ${track.width}x${track.height}');
    print('${track.bitRate} bps / ${track.framesPerSecond} fps');
    break;
  }
}
await player.selectAudioTrack(trackId);
await player.selectSubtitleTrack(trackId);
await player.addExternalSubtitle('/path/to/subtitle.srt');
await player.setSubtitleScale(1.2);
// Fallback subtitle look (colors are 0xRRGGBBAA). Omitted arguments keep
// whatever this player last applied; overrideMask bits also replace the
// styling an ASS script carries.
await player.setSubtitleStyle(
  fontFamily: 'Source Han Sans SC',
  primaryColorRgba: 0xFFFFFFFF,
  outlineColorRgba: 0x0000007F,
  fontSize: 48,
  outlineWidth: 2,
  overrideMask:
      kErikaSubtitleOverrideFontName |
      kErikaSubtitleOverrideColors |
      kErikaSubtitleOverrideFontSizeFields |
      kErikaSubtitleOverrideBorder,
);

// Danmaku
await player.loadDanmakuFile('/path/to/danmaku.xml');
await player.addDanmakuTrackJson(jsonString, name: 'source', offset: Duration.zero);
await player.setDanmakuConfig(fontSize: 30, displayArea: 0.5);

// Native diagnostics HUD (disabled by default)
await player.setDebugHudEnabled(true);
final presenterStats = await player.getPresenterStats();

// Events
player.events.listen((event) {
  // event.kind, event.state, event.position, event.duration, ...
});

await player.dispose();
```

## Media Track Information

`tracks()` returns an `ErikaTrackInfo` for every embedded or external track. A video track
provides `codec`, `width`, `height`, `pixelFormat`, `profile`, `level`, `bitRate`,
`frameRateNumerator`, and `frameRateDenominator`; audio tracks additionally provide
`sampleRate`, `channels`, and `sampleFormat`.

- `bitRate` is in bit/s. Erika prefers the video track's own codec parameters; only when there is
  exactly one video track with no declared bitrate and the container bitrate plus every other
  media track's bitrate (audio, subtitle, other video) are known does it estimate video bitrate as
  container bitrate minus those. It is `null` when
  unavailable, is not an instantaneous runtime bitrate, and an estimate can include container
  overhead or non-audio streams.
- `frameRateNumerator` / `frameRateDenominator` retain the rational value, preventing values
  such as `30000/1001` from being truncated. The probe order is average frame rate,
  `r_frame_rate`, then FFmpeg's guessed frame rate. `framesPerSecond` is a Dart convenience
  getter; for variable-frame-rate media it remains an average, declared, or guessed value.
- `TracksChanged` and `TrackSelectionChanged` events include the complete `trackList`. Hosts may
  also call `tracks()` again after either event to obtain a current snapshot.

```dart
player.events.listen((event) {
  if (event.kind == ErikaEventKind.tracksChanged) {
    for (final track in event.trackList) {
      if (track.kind == ErikaTrackKind.video && track.selected) {
        print(track.toMap());
        break;
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Native Debug HUD

`setDebugHudEnabled(true)` makes Erika draw a diagnostic HUD in the native video composition. It
does not render through Dart or alter the Flutter widget hierarchy. It is off by
default and intended for development, performance analysis, and on-device diagnosis.

The low-frequency HUD snapshot includes track codec/resolution/bitrate/frame rate, playback
position and rate, decoded and rendered FPS, hardware/software decode route, zero-copy/fallback
counters, CPU/GPU render times, audio queue and underflow, HDR output negotiation, and danmaku
item count. FPS is derived from adjacent sampling windows; frame and failure counters are
cumulative for the presenter lifetime. The HUD is excluded from `screenshot()` off-screen captures.

For a custom UI, use `getPresenterStats()` to retrieve the latest native display-tick snapshot. It
does not drive the HUD, and its freshness depends on an attached surface and active display loop.

## Neural Upscaler Status

`setUpscaler` requests a mode; the kernels are compiled on a background thread,
so the host should poll `getUpscalerStatus` to drive its UI:

| `activeBackend` | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| `off` | No mode requested. |
| `building` | Kernels compiling (first use of a mode); frames render unscaled until ready. |
| `inactive` | Mode requested but not applied — kernels not ready (and not compiling), or the backend recorded a fallback/failure. |
| `scalar` | Running on the Metal scalar or wgpu compute backend. |
| `simdgroupMatrix` | Running on the `simdgroup_matrix` backend (Apple Silicon default). |

The upscaler only engages when the drawable shows the video larger than its
source resolution, so a 1080p source in a 1080p (or smaller) view stays
`inactive`. C4F16 is the real-time recommendation; C4F16 DS targets heavily
compressed or noisy sources at the same compute cost. On Apple, C4F32 generally
needs an M-Pro/Max-class GPU at 1080p input; on Android, both models use Vulkan
compute and GLES reports an explicit `inactive` fallback. See
`docs/architecture.md` for the renderer-side design.

## Ownership Rule

Flutter owns layout and controls. Erika owns the video plane, subtitle plane,
danmaku plane, audio, and timing. The plugin bridges commands and events through
a `MethodChannel`; rendering never passes through Dart.
